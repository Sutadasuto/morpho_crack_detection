This function uses the eigenvectors of the Hessian to compute the likeliness of an image region to contain vessels or other image ridges , according to the method described by Frangi (2001)

It supports both 2D images and 3D volumes.

The 3D method contains an c-code file which can calculate fast the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a list of image Hessians. First compile this code with "mex eig3volume.c"

Try the examples.
- The 2D example detects vessels in an x-ray image
- The 3D example detects an aortic stent in a CT volume

Example,
I=double(imread ('vessel.png'));
Ivessel=FrangiFilter2D(I);
figure,
subplot(1,2,1), imshow(I,[]);
subplot(1,2,2), imshow(Ivessel,[0 0.25]);
